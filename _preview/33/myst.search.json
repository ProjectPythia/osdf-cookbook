Users are often encouraged to download datasets locally and then compute on the data locally as repositories are built for archiving and curation, not scale.\n\nHow does Netflix do it?  They leverage a content distribution network (CDN) which caches copies of the most popular movies at opportune locations on the Internet closer to users.\n\nThe OSDF is an NSF-funded infrastructure providing a CDN for science.  It is connected to popular open science repositories and has hardware embedded across US and international networks and at large computing sites.\n\nThis cookbook provides examples of using the OSDF’s streaming to power science use cases in earth sciences.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/osdf-intro","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Streaming Data with the Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)","lvl2":"Do first, understand later"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/osdf-intro#do-first-understand-later","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Streaming Data with the Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)","lvl2":"Do first, understand later"},"content":"How do you use the OSDF?\n\nThe service is powered by the same protocol as the web, HTTPS.

For this, a command line client - pelican is utilized.  Try running the following:\n\npelican object get osdf:///routeviews/chicago/route-views.chicago/bgpdata/2025.03/RIBS/rib.20250319.0400.bz2 ./\n\nDepending on the speed of your Internet connection, you may see a progress bar as the download proceeds.\n\nCongratulations, you’re now the proud owner of 72MB of Internet routing data!\n\nFor both of these cases, we downloaded the entire object.  What happens if the dataset contains data for the entire planet but you are only interested in the state of Nebraska?  It’s more effective to stream the subset.

Similarly, you don’t need to understand the guts of the OSDF to use it in your science.  However, a few key concepts are useful!\n\nOSDF Infrastructure: The map below shows the distributed pieces of the OSDF:\n\nEach “O” on the map is an origin; the origin service connects an existing repository to the OSDF service, making some datasets available and protecting the repository from overload.  Origins are typically placed nearby where the data lives; the origin for the NCAR Research Data Archive (RDA) is in the same datacenter as the RDA.\n\nEach “C” is a cache.  The cache makes temporary copies of objects upon access so, on subsequent accesses, the object comes from the cache and not from the repository.  This reduces the load on the repository and, ideally, increases scalability.\n\nUnified Namespace: The OSDF provides a unified namespace for all available objects.  Each repository receives a unique prefix (the IceCube experiment’s data is available from /icecube; NCAR’s RDA is available from /ncar-rda) and the object can be referenced from within the prefix.\n\nFrom our RouteViews example above, we were interested in accessing the object named chicago/route-views.chicago/bgpdata/2025.03/RIBS/rib.20250319.0400.bz2.  Since the prefix for RouteViews is /routeviews, the entire OSDF name is:osdf://routeviews/chicago/route-views.chicago/bgpdata/2025.03/RIBS/rib.20250319.0400.bz2\n\nImmutable Objects: The OSDF assumes that objects are immutable; once created, they aren’t permitted to be changed.  This allows OSDF to effectively make copies of the objects in the caches.\n\nThis typically works well with scientific datasets: you rarely change your data after you record it!  However, if you start using OSDF more heavily, this is an important requirement to be aware of.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/osdf-intro#about-the-osdf","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Streaming Data with the Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)","lvl2":"Finding My Objects"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/osdf-intro#finding-my-objects","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Streaming Data with the Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)","lvl2":"Finding My Objects"},"content":"How do you find the object you’re interested in?\n\nTypically, dataset providers connected to the OSDF provide a search, data catalog, or STAC catalog publishing OSDF-style URLs.  You can determine this from the provider’s website; additionally, OSDF maintains a list of known links you can peruse.\n\nExplore this cookbook: This cookbook provides examples for how to use OSDF to access:\n\nNCAR’s Research Data Archive.\n\nAWS’s OpenData Program.\n\nThe Envistor platform at Florida International University.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/osdf-intro#finding-my-objects","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Project Pythia Notebook Template"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/notebooks/cesm2","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Project Pythia Notebook Template"},"content":"Let’s start here!
