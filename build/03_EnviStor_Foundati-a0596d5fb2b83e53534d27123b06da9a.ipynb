    "## Summary\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored the motivation, context, and scientific importance of analyzing salinity patterns in South Florida. We introduced the curated buoy datasets processed through the EnviStor smart data pipeline and made accessible via PelicanFS, part of the Open Science Data Federation. The reader now understands why salinity matters, how the data was collected and prepared, and what question the upcoming technical notebook will answer. This context sets the stage for a reproducible, user-facing environmental analysis powered by FAIR data infrastructure.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Load salinity datasets** for three buoy stations (NW Biscayne Bay, Haulover Inlet, and Little River) directly from OSDF via PelicanFS.\n",
    "- **Combine and clean the data**: We’ll merge the datasets into a single time series, convert timestamps, label each station, and handle any missing or invalid salinity readings.\n",
    "- **Resample to daily averages** to reduce noise and highlight broader trends.\n",
    "- **Visualize the results** using line plots to show salinity over time for each location, making it easy to compare patterns across stations.\n",
    "- **Analyze temporal and spatial patterns**, such as seasonal variations, sudden shifts, or location-specific behaviors that may suggest environmental changes like saltwater intrusion or storm impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will give users a complete, reproducible workflow that demonstrates how curated environmental data can be analyzed using standard Python tools — all made possible by the EnviStor pipeline and OSDF infrastructure.\n"
